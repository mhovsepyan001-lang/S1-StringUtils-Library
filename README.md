# **S1-StringUtils-Library**

This library solves the problem of missing high-level string utilities in the C programming language.
In languages like Python, operations such as splitting, joining, trimming, and modifying strings are built-in and easy to use.
In C, these operations require manual memory management, pointer handling, and careful allocation to avoid leaks or crashes.

**S1-StringUtils-Library provides safe, ready-to-use C implementations** of common string functions, making it easier to perform these operations without rewriting them from scratch.
